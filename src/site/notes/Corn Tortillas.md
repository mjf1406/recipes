## Ingredients
- [ ] Masa harina, 240 grams
- [ ] Hot water, 1 1/2 to 1 2/3 cups (356 grams
- [ ] Fine sea salt, 3/4 teaspoon
## Equipment
- [ ] Non-stick skillet
- [ ] Tortilla press
- [ ] Ziplock bag
- [ ] Big mixing bowl
- [ ] wooden spoon or silicone spatula #stirring-utensil
- [ ] food scale
## Instructions
There are two ways to make these, but I prefer doing it with a partner.
1. 2 people: use the #partner-1 and #partner-2 tags with the letter suffixes
2. 1 person: while cooking the first side, prepare the ball for pressing, while cooking the second side, press the tortilla and remove it
### Mix the Dough
1. [ ] Grab the big mixing bowl
2. [ ] Whisk the masa harina and salt together briefly
3. [ ] Slowly add the 1 1/2 cups of hot water while stirring the mixture with the #stirring-utensil until the dough begins to form #partner-1a 
4. [ ] Use your hands to knead the dough for 2-3 minutes in the bowl until it is smooth and forms a cohesive ball. The texture should be springy and firm, similar to Play-Doh. #partner-2a
		- If the dough is too wet, sticking to your hands, add in some more masa harina a little bit at a time.
		- if the dough is too dry, crackly, add in some extra water slowly.
### Rest the Dough
1. [ ] Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel or paper towel.
2. [ ] Let the dough rest for 60 minutes.
### Portion the Dough
1. [ ] Grab the food scale
2. [ ] Portion the dough into 35 gram slobs, then use your hands to roll it into a sphere #partner-1 
### Press the Dough Balls
1. [ ] Grab the ziplock bag and tortilla press
2. [ ] Place a tortilla sphere into the bag
3. [ ] Place the bag onto the torilla press
4. [ ] Press the tortilla
5. [ ] Take the tortilla out and put it on a piece of wax paper, stacking additional tortillas in the same way
### Cook the Tortillas
1. [ ] Heat the non-stick pan over medium-high heat
2. [ ] Once it is hot enough, gently peel the totilla off the wax paper and lay it flat in the pan
3. [ ] Cook the toritlla for 40-60 seconds per side, flipping once speckled brown spots begin to appear. Bubbles are a good sign!
4. [ ] Transfer the tortilla to a bowl wrapped in a damp kitchen towel or paper towel, so they do not dry out
