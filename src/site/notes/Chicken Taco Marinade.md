## Ingredients

- [ ] 500 kg boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts
#### Liquid
- [ ] 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (60 mL), plus 1 teaspoon zest (~3-4 limes)

	- Replacing with lemon juice is okay
- [ ] 1/4 cup olive oil (60 mL)

- [ ] 2 teaspoons minced garlic (omit for low-fodmap)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon onion powder (omit for low-fodmap)
- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- [ ] 1 teaspoon paprika
- [ ] 1-1/4 teaspoon ground chili powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

- [ ] plastic zipper bag, 18 x 17 x 4 cm, x1
- [ ] chef's knife
- [ ] wooden cutting board
- [ ] non-stick frying pan, 26 cm
## Instructions

### Preparation
#### Chicken
1. Open the zipper bag and get it ready to put the chicken inside.
2. Slice the chicken across its width into strips that are about 5-7 cm wide.
3. Put the chicken breast strips into the zipper bag.
#### Marinade
1. pour into the zipper bag the 60 mL of olive oil
2. put into the zipper bag all of the dry marinade ingredients
3. put into the zipper bag the 60 mL of lime juice
4. close the zipper bag
5. shake it until the marinade is evenly distributed within the bag and the chicken is submerged and well-coated.
6. Let it marinade for at least 4 hours in the refridgerator
	1. I recommend you let it marinade for 12 hours overnight, but no more than 12 hours because the acidity from the lime juice can make the chicken's texture become off
### Cooking
1. take the zipper bag full of marinating chicken breast out of the fridge 30 minutes before you begin to cook.
2. after about 25 minutes, turn your burner onto medium heat and let the pan warm up for 5 minutes.
3. place the chicken into the pan and spread it around the pan evenly
4. with as little water as possible, rinse the zipper bag, shake it around to get all the marinade into the water, then pour the water gently into the frying pan.
5. cook until the chicken is done
6. remove the chicken from the frying pan
7. reduce heat slightly, and reduce the sauce until your desired thickness.
### Storing Recommendations
I recommend you store the chicken in the sauce. The way I store it is dividing the chicken into 3 servings and placing those servings into separate silicone storage containers, then laddle 2+ tablespoons of sauce onto each until I have no more sauce, then store in the fridge and eat within 3-4 days.
